		<h2>Disassembled my old laptop</h2>
		<p>Flexible people have a desktop PC and a laptop to work if they are on the road. I also have a laptop, but the problem is</p><p> the laptop isn't really flexible. He is loud and he becomes hot if I work more than 20 minutes with it.</p><p> Today I disassembled my laptop, to look whats inside. I cleaned the fan and removed one screw and now? IT'S WORKING CORRECTLY. Being happy to be allowed to take my laptop now onto the road.</p><p> I will push a disassembly guide later written in Markdown or TeX (don't know yet).</p>
